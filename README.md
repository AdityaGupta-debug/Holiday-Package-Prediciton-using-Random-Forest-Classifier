# 🗺️ Holiday Package Prediction

Planning holidays is exciting, but predicting whether a customer will actually book a holiday package is even more interesting! ✈️🌍

This project uses the **Holiday Package Prediction Dataset** to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will purchase a holiday package, based on their demographics and travel preferences. It mirrors real-world challenges faced by travel agencies 🏢 looking to improve targeted marketing strategies 🎯.

## 📖 About the Dataset

The dataset consists of records where each row represents one potential customer — like a traveler walking into a holiday booking office. For each customer, we know their:
