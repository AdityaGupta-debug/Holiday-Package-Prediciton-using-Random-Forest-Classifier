🗺️ Holiday Package Prediction Dataset
📖 About the Dataset
Planning holidays is exciting, but predicting whether a customer will actually book a holiday package is even more interesting! ✈️🌍

The Holiday Package Prediction dataset is designed to help us build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will purchase a holiday package or not based on their demographic details and preferences. 🏖️🧳

It reflects real-world scenarios faced by travel agencies 🏢 and holiday planners trying to boost sales through targeted marketing 🎯.
